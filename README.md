# ANN_Implementation_From_Scratch
ANN model with preprocessing, feature transformation, and deep learning techniques to classify data with optimized accuracy.

ü§ñ ANN Model for Classification ‚Äì Deep Learning Lab 4
This project demonstrates the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using deep learning techniques to perform classification on a given dataset. The focus is on data preprocessing, feature transformation, and optimization using suitable activation, loss, and optimization functions to improve classification accuracy.

üß† Objective
Preprocess and prepare the dataset for deep learning.

Build a custom ANN model using Keras/TensorFlow.

Optimize model performance using:

Proper activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, softmax)

Suitable loss functions (e.g., categorical/binary cross-entropy)

Effective optimizers (e.g., Adam, SGD)

üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed
‚úÖ 1. Data Preprocessing
Loaded dataset using pandas

Handled missing values, duplicates, outliers

Applied Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding

Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler

‚úÖ 2. Model Building
Built ANN using Sequential model from Keras

Used appropriate:

Dense layers with suitable neuron counts

ReLU or sigmoid activation for hidden layers

softmax or sigmoid for output layer based on target classes

‚úÖ 3. Compilation & Training
